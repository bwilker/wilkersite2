__Hello!__

I'm a professor of [political science](https://suny.oneonta.edu/political-science) at [SUNY Oneonta](https://suny.oneonta.edu/). 

Born in Wichita, Kansas and raised in Texas, I have lived in upstate New York for the last 30-plus years. I enjoy cycling and wandering around, occassionaly taking photos with my wife Jennifer. I have two adult children, Emily and Noah. 

I am the board of the [Schenectady Greenmarket](https://www.schenectadygreenmarket.com/). Come visit us on [Sundays from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Schenectady+Greenmarket/@42.8143124,-73.942029,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89de6e0625d4a119:0x85e829b314b0770!8m2!3d42.8143085!4d-73.939835)  

On wilkersite, I hope to explore some of my interests with occasional posts.
