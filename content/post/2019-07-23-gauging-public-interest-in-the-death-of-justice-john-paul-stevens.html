<p>Justice John Paul Stevens died on July XXXX, 2019. He retired about a decade ago and was replaced by Elana Kagen on the bench. Over the last few years I have been investigating when the general public becomes interested in the Supreme Court as an institution, in the Court’s members, and in the cases that the Court decides.</p>
<p>In this post I will look at interest generated by Stevens’ recent death. How do we know if the public is interested? I have explored two tools: Wikipedia page views and Google Trends. Wikipedia reports page views on a daily basis and these are relatively easy to access. Google reports web searching for terms, including people, and reports data through a variety of lenses, both short term and long term, reporting out an index with 100 being the highest search time period. I will also be looking at two measures of media coverage for comparison: cable news coverage as recorded by the XXXX and the number of news stories as collected by XXXX. For all of this data, I have gone back to the beginning of the available Wikipedia page view data, December 2007 with the exception of the cable news data which is only available from XXXX, XXXX.</p>
