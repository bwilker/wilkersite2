I have moved many of my classes to specifications grading over the last two years. Using specifications grading assignments are grading on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.[^1] I have written on this [before](http://activelearningps.com/2017/08/02/specification-grading-in-an-online-course/). If you want to find more about specifications grading I suggest Linda Nilson's book and her Inside Higher Education essay. Robert Talbert has written extensively on this grading strategy. Two examples in political science are a recent article by [Blackstone and Oldmixon](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15512169.2018.1447948) in the _Journal of Political Science Education_ and a series of blog posts by [Amanda Rosen](http://activelearningps.com/2016/03/30/specifications-grading/) on the Active Learning in Political Science blog. 

In this post I want to write about subject related that is often ignored: how to assign grades using a plus/minus grading system. I decided that having separate bundles for each incremental grade from failing through A—twelve in total—was too many.  In Nilson's book, she writes about A-F grading without +/-. Generally creating 5 bundles of assignments. Most of the examples I found online did the same. We use +/- grading at SUNY Oneonta and I was concerned that _not- using +/- would undermine this already new grading system in the eyes of many students. My chair and dean were also a bit concerned about me only assigning full letter grades.[^2] So what to do? 

## A search for examples
I didn't do an exhaustive search, but I did find a couple of examples that were helpful. The first came from [Robert Talbert](http://rtalbert.org/return-to-specs-grading-calculus/) who describes his refined specifications grading approach in his calculus class. After slotting into a letter grade bundle, students can earn a plus or minus depending on their performance on a comprehensive final, used solely for this purpose and the number of experience points (XP) that they earn through classroom and online engagement. 

> The base grade gets a + or - modifier depending on what happens with the final exam and XP:

>> * If the final exam grade is at least 85%, and at least 85 XP are earned, add a "+" to the base grade.
>> * If the final exam grade is less than or equal to 50%, or 50 XP or fewer are earned, add a "-" to the base grade.
>> * Otherwise the course grade equals the base grade.
> So blowing it on the final, or willfully disengaging with the class (while still getting required work done) will not kill your grade, but it won't be without effects either. On the other hand, doing really well on the final and staying engaged with the class gives you a bonus, but not a massive boost.

In a second example, Julie Mendez of Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus reports that in her engineering courses she assigns a plus grade for students who complete one requirement of the next higher grade bundle and a minus grade for students who complete all of a letter grade bundle except for the pre-class homework. 

## The two paths I chose
Each of these approaches had some appeal for me, but I didn't follow either of them exactly. I have used specifications grading in two classes in the past, US Government and our research methods class, and this fall I converted my Law, Courts and Politics class to specifications grading. I have taken two different paths in these courses. 

In _Law Courts and Politics_, an upper-division course that enrolls political science majors, criminal justice majors, and pre-law students, I created bundles as Nilson and others describe for the five letter grades. DETAILS.

In both _US Government_, an introductory general education course that is required of political science majors, and _research methods_, required of all majors in the political science department, I have chosen an alternative. I use specifications grading for almost all assignments,[^3] but I have [gamified the assignments:](http://www.gamefulpedagogy.com/) students are allowed to collect points through assignments that they choose to complete. EXPLAIN



[^1]: Satisfactory doesn't mean pass/fail. Generally instructors using specifications grading use a B as satisfactory. 
[^2]: In fairness, both my chair and dean said they would support me if I chose to not use +/- grading. 
[^3]: The exception is reading quizzes in US Government where students earn points for
