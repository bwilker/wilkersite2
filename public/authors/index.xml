      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a professor of political science at SUNY Oneonta who has interests in law and courts. He teaches a range of public law courses&amp;ndash;Law Courts and Politics, Civil Rights and Liberties, and American Constitutional Development&amp;ndash;US Government and research methods. I am also interested in R and data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Wichita, Kansas and raised in Texas, I have lived in upstate New York for the last 30-plus years. I enjoy cycling and wandering around taking photos with my wife Jennifer. I am the board of the Schenectady Greenmarket. Come visit us on Sundays from 10am - 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On wilkersite, I hope to explore some of my interests with occasional posts and information about my teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
